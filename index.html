                <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
                <strong><small>"Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value."  Albert Einstein</small>
                <p>I was born in San Antonio, Texas, on September 27, 1972, and that is where I still reside at today.  One of my deepest passion's is studying the law (mostly, both criminal and civil law).  I really enjoy assisting those who are incarcerated and seeking a form of relief from the Courts (whether it be for a denial of medical care, physical abuse by an officer, or for being housed in unconstitutional living conditions)--to prepare and file legal materials with the Courts. (Click on links 1-4 above to find a history of my participation in articles and publications, seeking prison reform in Texas.  Specifically, in seeking an end to Texas's use of solitary confinement on targeted groups of its prisoners.)  I also enjoy drawing portraits (the articles contained in Links 1 and 2 above, showcase artwork I contributed to the journalists' articles that I took part in in order to shed light towards the cause for seeking prison reform in Texas).  In addition, I absolutely love both singing and playing the guitar as well.  Lastly, I am currently dating a beautiful woman, and we plan to be married by April 2023. </p>

                 <p>Recently, I worked as a contractor in Virginia (the 3 photos of shown here in my portfolio were taken in May 2022, in Charlottesville, Virginia, during my time there while working).  The company I worked for is called Belfor Property Restoration.  That company treated me with the highest level of respect and appreciation.  Belfor is a class act corporation and I am so greatful to have had the opportunity to work for them as a contractor.  In addition, I am now employed as a Travel Consultant for Canyon Travel.  Canyon Travel owns and operates ecotour, adventure trips to Copper Canyon, Mexico.  Copper Canyon has been selected by National Geographic magazine as one of 50 tours of a lifetime.</p>

                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <strong><small>"I would teach peace rather than war.  I would inculate love rather than hate."  Albert Einstein</strong></small>
                <p>As someone whose been caught up in the juducial system and incarcerated--I am grateful for my freedom and to have a second chance at life.  I believe that education is the key to changing the mindsets of the young and the old who find themselves either living in poverty or going in and out of the prison system.  I've learned some hard lessons in life.  But I chose not to give up on myself.  I'm reclaimimg my life back.  Improving my education is a tremendous leap forard for me in my life.  Now it's all about putting in the hard work that studying entails.  I am eager to successfully complete my course with Coding Temple in order to prove to myself, family, and friends--that no matter bad a situation in life may be--how low in life you may feel--as humans we are resilient and designed with the capabilities to overcome any difficult obstacles life may throw our way.  I'm serving as living proof of that.  My goal is to be a part of the tech industry as a software engineer.  Technology is important in that it can be used for the betterment of people.  I want to be a part of that purpose.</p>
